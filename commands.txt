% Hi I am an example of how to specify what a servo valve needs to do
% Any line starting with a % is a comment
% Servos work through their command lists in parallel

servoNum 0 %Specify commands for servo 0 to do

% The line below is ignored as it has a comment at the start
% servoAngle 10 %Move servo 0 to 10 degrees

valveAngle 90 %Move servo 0 so the valve it controls is at 90 degrees (CLOSED fully)
waitMillis 1500 %Wait 1.5 sec, can only specify a max value of 65535 to wait millis
valveAngle 0 %Move servo 0 so the valve it controls is at 0 degrees (OPEN fully)
waitSec 2 %Wait 2 sec, can only specify a max value of 65535 to wait sec. For longer use waitSec twice
valveAngle 45 %Move servo 0 so the valve it controls is halfway open
waitSec 2
valveAngle 90 %Close the valve again
