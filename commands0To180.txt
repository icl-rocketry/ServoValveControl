% Hi I am an example of how to specify what a servo valve needs to do
% Any line starting with a % is a comment
% Servos work through their command lists in parallel

servoNum 0 %Specify commands for servo 0

% The line below is ignored as it has a comment at the start
servoAngle 0 %Move servo 0 to 0 degrees
waitSec 5
servoAngle 180
waitSec 5
servoAngle 0
